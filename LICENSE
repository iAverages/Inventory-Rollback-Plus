Definitions
1) I, me & TechnicallyCoded - all refer to the person who rightfully withheld
 ownership of the premium Mojang account under the Minecraft name
 "TechnicallyCoded", the 15th of November 2020. (This way of referencing
 who I am is to avoid doxxing myself all while making it possible to verify
 the person who owns the account through an independent 3rd party, which in 
 this case would be Mojang)
2) Project & The repository - refer to the entirety of code files and resources 
 present in the github repository https://github.com/TechnicallyCoded/Inventory-Rollback-Plus
 OR any files and resources packaged into the InventoryRollbackPlus plugin I
 authored.

was forked from. You may fork this repository for the sole purpose of 
contributing back to the project (such as creating pull requests for feature
